# Image-Carousel
A carousel featuring multiple images that can be advanced or reversed, seamlessly, with custom arrow buttons.

This project focused more on pure, vanilla javascript and how to manipulate DOM elements. I also wanted to create the buttons in CSS instead of relying on a SVG/PNG file or a font glyph.

My plan is to push this project a little further by adding text captions, lower navigation dots, and a sliding transition effect to advance my knowledge of Javascript and it's interactive capabilities.
